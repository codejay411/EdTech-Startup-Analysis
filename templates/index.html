                        Educational technology (Ed-Tech) is a technology that typically aids in the facilitation
                        of cooperation in an active learning setting. Educators can use educational technology
                        to develop digital, interactive textbooks, gamify courses, take attendance, assign
                        homework, hold quizzes and assessments, and receive real-time results linked to
                        teaching subject, style, and format. Traditional education and teaching methods are
                        being disrupted by educational technology, which allows both teachers and students to
                        learn in an environment that makes use of now-common gadgets such as
                        smartphones, computers, and tablets</p>
