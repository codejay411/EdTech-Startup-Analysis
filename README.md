# EdTech-Startup-Analysis

Educational technology (Ed-Tech) refers to a wide range of teaching and
learning-related software and hardware that is increasingly being used in college and
university classrooms. The ultimate purpose of educational technology, commonly
known as Ed Tech, is to provide a better learning environment, which in turn is
intended to improve student results. It's also been shown to boost student involvement
and participation in class.

Educational technology (Ed-Tech) is a technology that typically aids in the facilitation
of cooperation in an active learning setting. Educators can use educational technology
to develop digital, interactive textbooks, gamify courses, take attendance, assign
homework, hold quizzes and assessments, and receive real-time results linked to
teaching subject, style, and format. Traditional education and teaching methods are
being disrupted by educational technology, which allows both teachers and students to
learn in an environment that makes use of now-common gadgets such as
smartphones, computers, and tablets.
